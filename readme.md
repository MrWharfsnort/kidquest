# KidQuest

KidQuest replaces traditional physical behavior charts with more interactive goal oriented “Kid Quests”. These kid quests help promote good behaviour such as playing outside, eating right or helping out around the house. Once a task/quest is complete they can gain either a digital or physical reward.
